# Lab Mobile Robotics winter semester 2022/2023

Worked on various projects in this lab, including implementing a wall follower for a mobile robot, an A*-search algorithm using C++, and utilizing [Robot Operating System (ROS)](https://ros.org/). For more details, refer to the [ROS Documentation](https://wiki.ros.org/Documentation).

### Unit 01
- Developed basic functions for a mobile robot such as move and stop, SMPA (Sense Model Plan Act) architecture, Adaptive Monte Carlo Localization (AMCL), and point navigation.

### Unit 02
- Implemented a wall follower algorithm.

### Unit 03
- A*-search algorithm

### Unit 04
- Explored the interaction between camera objects and a mobile robot using OpenCV.
